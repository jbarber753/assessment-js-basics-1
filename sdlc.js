// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const analysisOfRequirements = `After the goal of the software is defined, developers will then determine what specifically will be needed for the software. All the required tools and features required to meet the defined goals of the software will be laid out before programming begins.`
const design = `Designers will take the plan, goals, and requirements into account and provide an outline documenting how the software should look/function specifically.`
const implementation = `The developers will take the design document and utilize the required tools to program the software, achieving the planned goals and adhering to the design document.`
const testingAndIntegration = `The QA team will verify that the software works as intended, identifying any potential bugs or edge cases that need addressing. When the integrity of the software is confirmed, the software is deployed, being made available to users.`
const maintain = `After the software is deployed, it is continuously updated. During this step, developers may add new eatures, update old ones, identify and fix new bugs, and optimize performance.`
